We proudly announce the final release of the long awaited major version 1.4 of Roundcube webmail.
After more than two years of hard work by Alec and other volunteer contributors, Roundcube
finally gets the responsive skin with full mobile device support - the Elastic.

In addition to the new UI we introduce these new features:

* Email Resent (Bounce) feature
* Improved [Mailvelope](https://www.mailvelope.com) integration
* Support for Redis and Memcached cache
* Support for SMTPUTF8 and GSSAPI

Plus numerous improvements and bug fixes collected from your precious feedback as well
as updates to recent versions of 3rd party libraries like jQuery and TinyMCE.

See the full changelog in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.4.0)
on the Github download page.

The new Elastic theme, which is the new default skin, is built with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and of course
the sources are included. They allow a certain degree of customization by adjusting some colors and variables
using the `_styles.less` and `_variables.less` files. Please consider customizing your Roundcube
installation in order to make [phishing](/news/2019/10/28/phishing-alert) harder.
You'll find guidance in the README.md file inside the skin folder.

This release is considered stable and we encourage you to update your productive installations 
after carefully testing the upgrade scenario and preparing your users to the significant changes
in their webmail UI. Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).

With the release of Roundcube 1.4.0, the previous stable release branches 1.3.x
and 1.2.x will change into LTS low maintenance mode which means they will only
receive important security updates but no longer any regular improvement updates.
The 1.1.x series is no longer supported and maintained.
