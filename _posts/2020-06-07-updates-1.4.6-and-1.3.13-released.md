title: Updates 1.4.6 and 1.3.13 released
tags: releases updates

We just published two follow-up releases to the recently published versions
[1.4.5 and 1.3.12](/news/2020/06/02/security-updates-1.4.5-and-1.3.12) of Roundcube Webmail.

They contain only a single fix for the installer's test step which was broken
with the last release. The update is therefore only relevant for new
installations which use the installer to set up Roundcube.

## Changelog

- Installer: Fix regression in SMTP test section ([#7417](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/7417))
