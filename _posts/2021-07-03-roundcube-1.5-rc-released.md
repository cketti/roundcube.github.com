We proudly announce the release candidate for the next major version 1.5 of Roundcube webmail.
Based on the feedback we received from the beta release and some new features from
the backlog, we have now finalized the development branch to prepare the final version.
See the changelog below for details.

Some noteworthy additions since 1.5-beta are

* Support of XOAUTH2 in Managesieve plugin
* Support of IMAP LITERAL- extension [RFC 7888]
* Support of RFC 2231 encoded names
* Plugin hooks for OAuth events

See the full changelog in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.5-rc)
on the Github download page.

We believe it is production ready, but we recommend to test it on a separate environment.
And don't forget to backup your data before installing it.
Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download#beta).

We also have some [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/roundcube/roundcubemail/tags?page=1&name=1.5-rc)
available for quick testing and evaluation.
