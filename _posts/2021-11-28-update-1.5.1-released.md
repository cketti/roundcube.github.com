This is the first service release to update the new stable version 1.5. It provides a bunch of small fixes and improvements after getting your feedback from the 1.5.0 release. See the full changelog in the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.5.1) on the Github download page.

## Important note for MySQL and MariaDB database backends

The change to full UTF-8 support in MySQL/MariaDB didn't work for everybody migrating an existing DB.
Hence here's an important notice from the [UPGRADING](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/blob/release-1.5/UPGRADING#L26) instructions:

If you use MySQL < 5.7.7 or MariaDB < 10.2.2 make sure to configure it with:

<code class="block">innodb_large_prefix=1
innodb_file_per_table=1
innodb_file_format=Barracuda
</code>

This release is considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations 
of Roundcube with this version. Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).

Please do backup your data before updating!
